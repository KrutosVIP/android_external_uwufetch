### From source

Build requisites:

- Make
- A C compiler
    - A iOS patched SDK (if you build UwUfetch under iOS device)

To install UwUfetch from the source, type these commands in the terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/TheDarkBug/uwufetch.git
cd uwufetch
make build # add "CFLAGS+=-D__IPHONE__" if you are building for iOS
sudo make install
```

```shell
cd uwufetch
sudo make uninstall
```

#### Available Make targets

```shell
make build              # builds uwufetch
make debug              # use for debug
make install            # installs uwufetch (needs root permissons)
make uninstall          # uninstalls uwufetch (needs root permissons)
```

## Images and copyright info

### How to use images

Notice: images are currently disabled under iOS due to lack of a one command in UwUfetch code

First of all, you will need `viu`, which you can install by following the [guide](https://github.com/atanunq/viu#installation).

`viu` supports [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty) and [iTerm](https://iterm2.com/)'s image protocols.
If not supported by the current terminal, `viu` uses the fallback Unicode half-block mode (images will look "blocky"), that is the case in many terminal emulators (gnome-terminal, Konsole, etc.). See also: [viu's README](https://github.com/atanunq/viu#description).

## Issues

### `MOWODEL` showing `To Be Filled By O.E.M.`

This happens when your computer hasn't had any [OEM info filled in](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/oem.asp) (habitually by the manufacturer).
While you could fill it yourself with your own custom info too, you can also disable the part of uwufetch which display this line.
Edit [`.config/uwufetch/config`] and add `host=false`.
